The only problem is that it's not really a hinge, but a pair of screws. I guess I should have known better\",\n          \"I've not played the adult version of Cashflow so can't make a comparison but this game does a good job of teaching a basic tenet from the Rich Dad series: amass sources of passive income!  I bought this to play with my six year old because he's very interested in money and investing.  I thought this might be a good introduction to some basic concepts - and I believe it is a good introduction.  The instructions are not great, good enough but not great.  The instructions describe that you become a winner when your passive income exceeds your expenses - but there isn't really a winner of the game.  Small nuance but each individual \\\"wins\\\" by having passive income exceed expenses but the instructions don't state the first one to get there wins.\\n\\nEach player gets a \\\"financial statement\\\" as their game card.  During play, each player gains passive income sources and expenses.  The players keep track of their passive income vs expenses on the financial statement.  When your passive income exceeds expenses... you win!  The game does a good job of reinforcing this concept and also does a good job providing examples of passive income sources (rental property, owning a business, etc.).  It's at a pretty basic level so understandable for kids; even my six year old understands the game well enough to be able to formulate a strategy or predict what he needs on the next turn in order to win.\\n\\nWould recommend as a basic concept teaching tool.  And it's a fun game, too!\",\n          \"My review, didn't receive any discount or free shipping.Very good quality.Nice bag.  Works great.  Great for emergencies.  Easy to get around and use.
